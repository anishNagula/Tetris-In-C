# Tetris in C with SDL2

A simple implementation of the classic Tetris game in **C**, using **SDL2** for graphics rendering. This project aims to replicate the core mechanics of Tetris while keeping the code minimal and easy to understand.

## 📌 Features
- Basic block movement (**left, right, down**)
- Collision detection
- Screen divided into a matrix for gameplay logic
- Block reuse after landing
- Smooth rendering using SDL2
